                       <span class="s0">Version 3, 19 November 2007</span>

 <span class="s0">Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;</span>
 <span class="s0">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</span>
 <span class="s0">of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span>

                            <span class="s0">Preamble</span>

  <span class="s0">The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</span>
<span class="s0">software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure</span>
<span class="s0">cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</span>

  <span class="s0">The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</span>
<span class="s0">to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,</span>
<span class="s0">our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to</span>
<span class="s0">share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</span>
<span class="s0">software for all its users.</span>

  <span class="s0">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span>
<span class="s0">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span>
<span class="s0">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span>
<span class="s0">them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</span>
<span class="s0">want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</span>
<span class="s0">free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</span>

  <span class="s0">Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights</span>
<span class="s0">with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer</span>
<span class="s0">you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute</span>
<span class="s0">and/or modify the software.</span>

  <span class="s0">A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that</span>
<span class="s0">improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they</span>
<span class="s0">receive widespread use, become available for other developers to</span>
<span class="s0">incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and</span>
<span class="s0">encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of</span>
<span class="s0">software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.</span>
<span class="s0">The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and</span>
<span class="s0">letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its</span>
<span class="s0">source code to the public.</span>

  <span class="s0">The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to</span>
<span class="s0">ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available</span>
<span class="s0">to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to</span>
<span class="s0">provide the source code of the modified version running there to the</span>
<span class="s0">users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on</span>
<span class="s0">a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source</span>
<span class="s0">code of the modified version.</span>

  <span class="s0">An older license, called the Affero General Public License and</span>
<span class="s0">published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is</span>
<span class="s0">a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has</span>
<span class="s0">released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under</span>
<span class="s0">this license.</span>

  <span class="s0">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span>
<span class="s0">modification follow.</span>

                       <span class="s0">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

  <span class="s0">0. Definitions.</span>

  <span class="s0">&quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.</span>

  <span class="s0">&quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</span>
<span class="s0">works, such as semiconductor masks.</span>

  <span class="s0">&quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</span>
<span class="s0">License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</span>

  <span class="s0">To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</span>
<span class="s0">in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</span>
<span class="s0">exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the</span>
<span class="s0">earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</span>

  <span class="s0">A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</span>
<span class="s0">on the Program.</span>

  <span class="s0">To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</span>
<span class="s0">permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</span>
<span class="s0">infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</span>
<span class="s0">computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,</span>
<span class="s0">distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</span>
<span class="s0">public, and in some countries other activities as well.</span>

  <span class="s0">To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</span>
<span class="s0">parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through</span>
<span class="s0">a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</span>

  <span class="s0">An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;</span>
<span class="s0">to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</span>
<span class="s0">feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</span>
<span class="s0">tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</span>
<span class="s0">extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</span>
<span class="s0">work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If</span>
<span class="s0">the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</span>
<span class="s0">menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</span>

  <span class="s0">1. Source Code.</span>

  <span class="s0">The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work</span>
<span class="s0">for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source</span>
<span class="s0">form of a work.</span>

  <span class="s0">A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</span>
<span class="s0">standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</span>
<span class="s0">interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</span>
<span class="s0">is widely used among developers working in that language.</span>

  <span class="s0">The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</span>
<span class="s0">than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</span>
<span class="s0">packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</span>
<span class="s0">Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</span>
<span class="s0">Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</span>
<span class="s0">implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component</span>
<span class="s0">(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</span>
<span class="s0">(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</span>
<span class="s0">produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</span>

  <span class="s0">The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</span>
<span class="s0">the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</span>
<span class="s0">work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</span>
<span class="s0">control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's</span>
<span class="s0">System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</span>
<span class="s0">programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</span>
<span class="s0">which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source</span>
<span class="s0">includes interface definition files associated with source files for</span>
<span class="s0">the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</span>
<span class="s0">linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</span>
<span class="s0">such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</span>
<span class="s0">subprograms and other parts of the work.</span>

  <span class="s0">The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</span>
<span class="s0">can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</span>
<span class="s0">Source.</span>

  <span class="s0">The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</span>
<span class="s0">same work.</span>

  <span class="s0">2. Basic Permissions.</span>

  <span class="s0">All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</span>
<span class="s0">copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</span>
<span class="s0">conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</span>
<span class="s0">permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a</span>
<span class="s0">covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</span>
<span class="s0">content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your</span>
<span class="s0">rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</span>
<span class="s0">convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</span>
<span class="s0">in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</span>
<span class="s0">of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</span>
<span class="s0">with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</span>
<span class="s0">the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</span>
<span class="s0">not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works</span>
<span class="s0">for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</span>
<span class="s0">and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</span>
<span class="s0">your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</span>

  <span class="s0">Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</span>
<span class="s0">the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</span>
<span class="s0">makes it unnecessary.</span>

  <span class="s0">3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</span>

  <span class="s0">No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</span>
<span class="s0">measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</span>
<span class="s0">11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</span>
<span class="s0">similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</span>
<span class="s0">measures.</span>

  <span class="s0">When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</span>
<span class="s0">circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</span>
<span class="s0">is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</span>
<span class="s0">the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</span>
<span class="s0">modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's</span>
<span class="s0">users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of</span>
<span class="s0">technological measures.</span>

  <span class="s0">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you</span>
<span class="s0">receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</span>
<span class="s0">appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</span>
<span class="s0">keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</span>
<span class="s0">non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</span>
<span class="s0">keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</span>
<span class="s0">recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</span>
<span class="s0">and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</span>

  <span class="s0">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</span>
<span class="s0">produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</span>
<span class="s0">terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span>

    <span class="s0">a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</span>
    <span class="s0">it, and giving a relevant date.</span>

    <span class="s0">b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</span>
    <span class="s0">released under this License and any conditions added under section</span>
    <span class="s0">7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</span>
    <span class="s0">&quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</span>

    <span class="s0">c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</span>
    <span class="s0">License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This</span>
    <span class="s0">License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</span>
    <span class="s0">additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</span>
    <span class="s0">regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no</span>
    <span class="s0">permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</span>
    <span class="s0">invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</span>

    <span class="s0">d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</span>
    <span class="s0">Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</span>
    <span class="s0">interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</span>
    <span class="s0">work need not make them do so.</span>

  <span class="s0">A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</span>
<span class="s0">works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</span>
<span class="s0">and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</span>
<span class="s0">in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</span>
<span class="s0">used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users</span>
<span class="s0">beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work</span>
<span class="s0">in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</span>
<span class="s0">parts of the aggregate.</span>

  <span class="s0">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</span>
<span class="s0">of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</span>
<span class="s0">machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</span>
<span class="s0">in one of these ways:</span>

    <span class="s0">a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span>
    <span class="s0">(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</span>
    <span class="s0">Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</span>
    <span class="s0">customarily used for software interchange.</span>

    <span class="s0">b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</span>
    <span class="s0">(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</span>
    <span class="s0">written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</span>
    <span class="s0">long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</span>
    <span class="s0">model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</span>
    <span class="s0">copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</span>
    <span class="s0">product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</span>
    <span class="s0">medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</span>
    <span class="s0">more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</span>
    <span class="s0">conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</span>
    <span class="s0">Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</span>

    <span class="s0">c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</span>
    <span class="s0">written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</span>
    <span class="s0">alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</span>
    <span class="s0">only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</span>
    <span class="s0">with subsection 6b.</span>

    <span class="s0">d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</span>
    <span class="s0">place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</span>
    <span class="s0">Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</span>
    <span class="s0">further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</span>
    <span class="s0">Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</span>
    <span class="s0">copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</span>
    <span class="s0">may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</span>
    <span class="s0">that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</span>
    <span class="s0">clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</span>
    <span class="s0">Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the</span>
    <span class="s0">Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</span>
    <span class="s0">available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</span>

    <span class="s0">e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</span>
    <span class="s0">you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</span>
    <span class="s0">Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</span>
    <span class="s0">charge under subsection 6d.</span>

  <span class="s0">A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</span>
<span class="s0">from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</span>
<span class="s0">included in conveying the object code work.</span>

  <span class="s0">A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</span>
<span class="s0">tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</span>
<span class="s0">or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</span>
<span class="s0">into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</span>
<span class="s0">doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular</span>
<span class="s0">product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a</span>
<span class="s0">typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</span>
<span class="s0">of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</span>
<span class="s0">actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</span>
<span class="s0">is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</span>
<span class="s0">commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</span>
<span class="s0">the only significant mode of use of the product.</span>

  <span class="s0">&quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,</span>
<span class="s0">procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</span>
<span class="s0">and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</span>
<span class="s0">a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</span>
<span class="s0">suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</span>
<span class="s0">code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</span>
<span class="s0">modification has been made.</span>

  <span class="s0">If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</span>
<span class="s0">specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</span>
<span class="s0">part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</span>
<span class="s0">User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</span>
<span class="s0">fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</span>
<span class="s0">Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</span>
<span class="s0">by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply</span>
<span class="s0">if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</span>
<span class="s0">modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</span>
<span class="s0">been installed in ROM).</span>

  <span class="s0">The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</span>
<span class="s0">requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</span>
<span class="s0">for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</span>
<span class="s0">the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a</span>
<span class="s0">network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</span>
<span class="s0">adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</span>
<span class="s0">protocols for communication across the network.</span>

  <span class="s0">Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</span>
<span class="s0">in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</span>
<span class="s0">documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</span>
<span class="s0">source code form), and must require no special password or key for</span>
<span class="s0">unpacking, reading or copying.</span>

  <span class="s0">7. Additional Terms.</span>

  <span class="s0">&quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</span>
<span class="s0">License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</span>
<span class="s0">Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</span>
<span class="s0">be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</span>
<span class="s0">that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions</span>
<span class="s0">apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</span>
<span class="s0">under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</span>
<span class="s0">this License without regard to the additional permissions.</span>

  <span class="s0">When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</span>
<span class="s0">remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</span>
<span class="s0">it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</span>
<span class="s0">removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place</span>
<span class="s0">additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</span>
<span class="s0">for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</span>

  <span class="s0">Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</span>
<span class="s0">add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of</span>
<span class="s0">that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</span>

    <span class="s0">a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</span>
    <span class="s0">terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</span>

    <span class="s0">b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</span>
    <span class="s0">author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal</span>
    <span class="s0">Notices displayed by works containing it; or</span>

    <span class="s0">c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</span>
    <span class="s0">requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in</span>
    <span class="s0">reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</span>

    <span class="s0">d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</span>
    <span class="s0">authors of the material; or</span>

    <span class="s0">e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some</span>
    <span class="s0">trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</span>

    <span class="s0">f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</span>
    <span class="s0">material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of</span>
    <span class="s0">it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for</span>
    <span class="s0">any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on</span>
    <span class="s0">those licensors and authors.</span>

  <span class="s0">All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further</span>
<span class="s0">restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you</span>
<span class="s0">received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</span>
<span class="s0">governed by this License along with a term that is a further</span>
<span class="s0">restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains</span>
<span class="s0">a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</span>
<span class="s0">License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</span>
<span class="s0">of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</span>
<span class="s0">not survive such relicensing or conveying.</span>

  <span class="s0">If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</span>
<span class="s0">must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</span>
<span class="s0">additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</span>
<span class="s0">where to find the applicable terms.</span>

  <span class="s0">Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</span>
<span class="s0">form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</span>
<span class="s0">the above requirements apply either way.</span>

  <span class="s0">8. Termination.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</span>
<span class="s0">provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</span>
<span class="s0">modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</span>
<span class="s0">this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</span>
<span class="s0">paragraph of section 11).</span>

  <span class="s0">However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</span>
<span class="s0">license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</span>
<span class="s0">provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</span>
<span class="s0">finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</span>
<span class="s0">holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</span>
<span class="s0">prior to 60 days after the cessation.</span>

  <span class="s0">Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</span>
<span class="s0">reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</span>
<span class="s0">violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</span>
<span class="s0">received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</span>
<span class="s0">copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</span>
<span class="s0">your receipt of the notice.</span>

  <span class="s0">Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</span>
<span class="s0">licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</span>
<span class="s0">this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</span>
<span class="s0">reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</span>
<span class="s0">material under section 10.</span>

  <span class="s0">9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</span>

  <span class="s0">You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</span>
<span class="s0">run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</span>
<span class="s0">occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</span>
<span class="s0">to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</span>
<span class="s0">nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</span>
<span class="s0">modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</span>
<span class="s0">not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</span>
<span class="s0">covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</span>

  <span class="s0">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</span>

  <span class="s0">Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</span>
<span class="s0">receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</span>
<span class="s0">propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible</span>
<span class="s0">for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an</span>
<span class="s0">organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</span>
<span class="s0">organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</span>
<span class="s0">work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</span>
<span class="s0">transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</span>
<span class="s0">licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could</span>
<span class="s0">give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</span>
<span class="s0">Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</span>
<span class="s0">the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</span>
<span class="s0">rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</span>
<span class="s0">not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</span>
<span class="s0">rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</span>
<span class="s0">(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</span>
<span class="s0">any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</span>
<span class="s0">sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</span>

  <span class="s0">11. Patents.</span>

  <span class="s0">A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</span>
<span class="s0">License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The</span>
<span class="s0">work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;.</span>

  <span class="s0">A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims</span>
<span class="s0">owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</span>
<span class="s0">hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</span>
<span class="s0">by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</span>
<span class="s0">but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</span>
<span class="s0">consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For</span>
<span class="s0">purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant</span>
<span class="s0">patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</span>
<span class="s0">this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</span>
<span class="s0">patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to</span>
<span class="s0">make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</span>
<span class="s0">propagate the contents of its contributor version.</span>

  <span class="s0">In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express</span>
<span class="s0">agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</span>
<span class="s0">(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</span>
<span class="s0">sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a</span>
<span class="s0">party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</span>
<span class="s0">patent against the party.</span>

  <span class="s0">If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</span>
<span class="s0">and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</span>
<span class="s0">to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</span>
<span class="s0">publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</span>
<span class="s0">then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</span>
<span class="s0">available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</span>
<span class="s0">patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</span>
<span class="s0">consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</span>
<span class="s0">license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have</span>
<span class="s0">actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</span>
<span class="s0">covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work</span>
<span class="s0">in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</span>
<span class="s0">country that you have reason to believe are valid.</span>

  <span class="s0">If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</span>
<span class="s0">arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</span>
<span class="s0">covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</span>
<span class="s0">receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</span>
<span class="s0">or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</span>
<span class="s0">you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</span>
<span class="s0">work and works based on it.</span>

  <span class="s0">A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within</span>
<span class="s0">the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</span>
<span class="s0">conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</span>
<span class="s0">specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered</span>
<span class="s0">work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</span>
<span class="s0">in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</span>
<span class="s0">to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</span>
<span class="s0">the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</span>
<span class="s0">parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</span>
<span class="s0">patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</span>
<span class="s0">conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</span>
<span class="s0">for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</span>
<span class="s0">contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</span>
<span class="s0">or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</span>

  <span class="s0">Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</span>
<span class="s0">any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</span>
<span class="s0">otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</span>

  <span class="s0">12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</span>

  <span class="s0">If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span>
<span class="s0">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</span>
<span class="s0">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a</span>
<span class="s0">covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</span>
<span class="s0">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</span>
<span class="s0">not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</span>
<span class="s0">to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</span>
<span class="s0">the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</span>
<span class="s0">License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</span>

  <span class="s0">13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.</span>

  <span class="s0">Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the</span>
<span class="s0">Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users</span>
<span class="s0">interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version</span>
<span class="s0">supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding</span>
<span class="s0">Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source</span>
<span class="s0">from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary</span>
<span class="s0">means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source</span>
<span class="s0">shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3</span>
<span class="s0">of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the</span>
<span class="s0">following paragraph.</span>

  <span class="s0">Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</span>
<span class="s0">permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</span>
<span class="s0">under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single</span>
<span class="s0">combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this</span>
<span class="s0">License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</span>
<span class="s0">but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version</span>
<span class="s0">3 of the GNU General Public License.</span>

  <span class="s0">14. Revised Versions of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</span>
<span class="s0">the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions</span>
<span class="s0">will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</span>
<span class="s0">address new problems or concerns.</span>

  <span class="s0">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the</span>
<span class="s0">Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General</span>
<span class="s0">Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the</span>
<span class="s0">option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</span>
<span class="s0">version or of any later version published by the Free Software</span>
<span class="s0">Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the</span>
<span class="s0">GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</span>
<span class="s0">by the Free Software Foundation.</span>

  <span class="s0">If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</span>
<span class="s0">versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's</span>
<span class="s0">public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</span>
<span class="s0">to choose that version for the Program.</span>

  <span class="s0">Later license versions may give you additional or different</span>
<span class="s0">permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</span>
<span class="s0">author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</span>
<span class="s0">later version.</span>

  <span class="s0">15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</span>

  <span class="s0">THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</span>
<span class="s0">APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT</span>
<span class="s0">HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY</span>
<span class="s0">OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,</span>
<span class="s0">THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</span>
<span class="s0">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM</span>
<span class="s0">IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF</span>
<span class="s0">ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span>

  <span class="s0">16. Limitation of Liability.</span>

  <span class="s0">IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</span>
<span class="s0">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS</span>
<span class="s0">THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY</span>
<span class="s0">GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE</span>
<span class="s0">USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF</span>
<span class="s0">DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD</span>
<span class="s0">PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),</span>
<span class="s0">EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF</span>
<span class="s0">SUCH DAMAGES.</span>

  <span class="s0">17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</span>

  <span class="s0">If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided</span>
<span class="s0">above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,</span>
<span class="s0">reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates</span>
<span class="s0">an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the</span>
<span class="s0">Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a</span>
<span class="s0">copy of the Program in return for a fee.</span>

                     <span class="s0">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>

            <span class="s0">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</span>

  <span class="s0">If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</span>
<span class="s0">possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</span>
<span class="s0">free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</span>

  <span class="s0">To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</span>
<span class="s0">to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</span>
<span class="s0">state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</span>
<span class="s0">the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span>

    <span class="s0">&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span>
    <span class="s0">Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</span>

    <span class="s0">This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify</span>
    <span class="s0">it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by</span>
    <span class="s0">the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or</span>
    <span class="s0">(at your option) any later version.</span>

    <span class="s0">This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</span>
    <span class="s0">but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</span>
    <span class="s0">MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the</span>
    <span class="s0">GNU Affero General Public License for more details.</span>

    <span class="s0">You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License</span>
    <span class="s0">along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.</span>

<span class="s0">Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</span>

  <span class="s0">If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer</span>
<span class="s0">network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to</span>
<span class="s0">get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its</span>
<span class="s0">interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that leads users to an archive</span>
<span class="s0">of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different</span>
<span class="s0">solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the</span>
<span class="s0">specific requirements.</span>

  <span class="s0">You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,</span>
<span class="s0">if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.</span>
<span class="s0">For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see</span>
